# FractPunk
FractPunk isn't just another fractal generator. It's a manifestation of creative entropy, merging the mathematical elegance of fractals with a spirit of mischief. Expect the unexpected as each piece is uniquely generated with random perturbations and a color palette inspired by the five shades of chaos.
